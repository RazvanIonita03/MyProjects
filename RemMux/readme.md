The RemMux project is a software tool designed for remote multiplexing. It allows users to remotely manage and stream content or services by multiplexing data streams from different sources into a unified output. This project typically involves handling multiple data channels or media streams in real-time, offering flexibility for managing complex communications.
The key technologies it uses include:
      -Networking protocols for remote communication and data transmission. 
      -Multiplexing techniques for combining multiple data streams into a single stream, optimizing the management of resources.
      -Real-time data processing for efficient and smooth data handling.
